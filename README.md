# Climate-Data-API
### by Ryan Skabelund

In order to prove to my dad that my room is the hottest in the house, I utilized ESP32 S2 Mini microproccessors running MicroPython to record and upload surrounding temperature to a web API at hourly intervals. Then I created an ASP.NET web API hosted on Microsoft Azure to process temperature data and store it in a SQL database. Now with all this data, I wanted to visualize it. So I used Jupyter to plot data in combination with local weather data, making it easy to quickly analyze trends and patterns.
